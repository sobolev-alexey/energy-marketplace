using this apis https://mam-api.dag.sh/docs/?http#mam-api 

they will have to create a JSON digital twin and take charge to store in the app, any MAM root key and index which is returned to them by the API




they send us the hash, we do not receive the location at all

so from our side we just receive a small payload and publish it to a MAM channel.
hash, MAM encryption key and existing MAM channel details are provided by the partner.
Is it correct?

we receive encrypted payload (hash of the location) and existing MAM channel details

so our service is stateless

how long the streams can be? Can we reset long streams at some point (after reaching specific length) and start another one?
I would say not often, once a month? Maybe less. I think we can reset streams as long as we communicate to the app. 

 can even store channel details internally, in order to close one long channel and start another one. This can be done internally, and for outside client will still appear as the single channel.


we would go for zero effort I would just explain how to do that using https://mam-api.dag.sh/ 

we could also store time and do time based fetch
Create one channel per user per day
Store prev channel details in local DB for fetching
add flag to optionally log info to DB
fetch in parallel, max 20 streams
Increase timeout to 540 or more
